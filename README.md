# Bakesy – Online Bakery Website (UI/UX Design) 🍰🎨

A playful **bakery website concept** designed to showcase a sweet and modern brand.  
This is a **practice project** where I designed both the **wireframe** and the **final UI** to demonstrate my end-to-end process — from structure to styling.

## Design Process 🎯
1. **Wireframe:** Planned the layout, navigation flow, and content hierarchy.  
2. **UI Design:** Applied a consistent color palette (pink + purple gradients), playful typography, and balanced spacing.  
3. **Interaction Goals:** Ensure users immediately see what the brand offers and can easily take action.

- Adding **basic prototyping in Figma** to simulate interactive flows
